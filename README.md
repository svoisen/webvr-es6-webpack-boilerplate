# WebVR Boilerplate with Webpack and ES2015

This is a starting point for web-based VR projects for that use [three.js](http://threejs.org). It is heavily-based on the original [webvr-boilerplate](http://github.com/borismus/webvr-boilerplate), and even uses it as a dependency, but modifies the original boilerplate to use [webpack](http://webpack.github.io) and ES2015 via [babel](http://babeljs.io).

## How to Use It
The easiest way to use this boilerplate is to simply clone this project and modify it as you see fit.
