# WebVR Boilerplate with Webpack and ES2015

This is a starting point for web-based VR projects for that use [three.js](http://threejs.org). It is heavily based on the original [webvr-boilerplate](http://github.com/borismus/webvr-boilerplate) project, and even uses it as a dependency, but modifies the original boilerplate to use [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io) and ES2015 via the [Babel](http://babeljs.io) transpiler.

## How to Use It
Simply clone this project and modify it as you see fit.
